# DSA-Journey

This repository contains my personal DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) preparation and C++ solutions, structured topic-wise according to **Striver's A2Z DSA Series**.

I'm exploring DSA to build a strong foundation and improve my problem-solving skills at my own pace.

## Topics Covered So Far

- 01_Basics
- 02_Recursion
- 03_Arrays
- 04_Hashing

More topics will be added as I continue learning and making progress.
